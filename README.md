# react-tic-tac-toe

The goal of this very simple project is to start using react to create web applications to ultimately be able to replace some of the static code in the oglike game.

This project heavily relies on this [link](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) to setup the initial folder and generate the base structure of the repository and then on this [link](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to handle the creation of the tic-tac-toe code.
