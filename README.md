# react-tic-tac-toe

The goal of this very simple project is to start using react to create web applications to ultimately be able to replace some of the static code in the oglike game.

This project heavily relies on this [link](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) to setup the initial folder and generate the base structure of the repository and then on this [link](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to handle the creation of the tic-tac-toe code.

# Next steps:

Here are some next steps that are suggested by the tutorial:

| Status | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| V | Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list |
| X | Bold the currently selected item in the move list |
| V | Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them |
| X | Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order |
| V | When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win |
| V | When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw |
